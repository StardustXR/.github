# Stardust XR

Stardust XR is a display server for VR and AR headsets on Linux-based systems. Stardust provides a 3D environment, where anything from 2D windows (including your existing apps!), to
3D apps build from objects can exist together in a physical space. 

## üñ•Ô∏è Installing

If you'd like to try out Stardust XR, detailed installation guides and walkthroughs, (including help setting up XR headsets within Linux) are available on our [website](https://stardustxr.org/docs/get-started/What-is-Stardust)
The quickest way to use it is with [Telescope](https://github.com/StardustXR/telescope), a bundled installation that comes with the [Stardust XR server](https://github.com/StardustXR/server) and a selection of clients to run. Stardust XR has a flatscreen mode as well, so even if you don't have an XR headset setup on your Linux distribution, you can still
try it out with desktop controls.  
```bash
sudo dnf install telescope
```

## üöÄ Sponsorship

Stardust XR is looking for [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/technobaboo)! Development has been led almost entirely by Nova for over 5 years, and as they have been a driving force behind developing XR within Linux distributions, sponsoring Stardust XR is supporting the future of XR.  

Follow us on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/ultramarineproj) & [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/stardustxr.org) for development updates, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/f3QfPHX6zv) server; we're also on Fosstodon @StardustXR
